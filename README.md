Focused on improving pneumonia diagnosis, particularly in regions with limited access to radiologists, our project utilized deep learning technology. We developed SZANet, a custom neural network, and compared its performance to the established ResNet152V2 using chest X-ray data. Both methods achieved similar accuracy in classifying images as 'healthy' or 'pneumonia,' demonstrating the efficacy of transfer learning in optimizing diagnostic processes and conserving resources by leveraging pre-existing parameters.
